- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- JavaScript
- react-lottie (for animations)
- Typewriter-Effect Library
- Intersection Observers API

## What I've Learned
### Vite:
- **Fast Development Environment:** Learned how Vite leverages native ES modules to serve files, leading to lightning-fast cold server starts and hot module replacement.
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Explored Vite's rich plugin system for easy integration of tools and libraries.
- **Optimized Builds:** Understood how Vite utilizes Rollup for small production bundles and efficient tree shaking.

### React:
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Mastered the modular nature of React by building reusable components.
- **Hooks:** Deepened understanding of React hooks for cleaner and more intuitive code.
- **Context and Global State:** Used the Context API for structured application state and avoided prop drilling.

### Tailwind:
- **Utility-First CSS:** Adopted the utility-first methodology for faster UI construction.
- **Customization:** Tailored the Tailwind framework to fit specific design requirements.
- **JIT Mode:** Used JIT mode for smaller stylesheets in production and dynamic values in utility classes.

## Web Dev Lessons
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured the web applications look and function well across all device types.
- **Animation Integration:** Utilized react-lottie for animations.
- **Performance Optimization:** Adopted best practices for swift page load, offering a seamless experience.
- **State Management in React:** Furthered my understanding of React hooks and state management.

## Advanced Features
- **Typewriter Effect:** Utilized the Typewriter-Effect library for dynamic text appearances.
- **Intersection Observers:** Implemented Intersection Observer API for lazy loading and scroll effects.
- **Lazy Loading:** Integrated lazy loading to optimize page load performance.
- **Scroll Effects:** Utilized custom CSS and JavaScript to create scroll-based animations.
